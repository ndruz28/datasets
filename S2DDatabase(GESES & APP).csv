Once the spring semester of the 2019-2020 school year approached, I began thinking more about what I wanted to do once I completed school. I thought about going straight into a corporate job, and once I was readily established, get my job to pay for graduate school. I then went into deeper thought about juggling work, life, and school all at once and knowing who I am, the thought didn’t appease me. I then thought about going straight into graduate school right after undergrad, seeing that I would still have momentum to keep going and the thought has stuck with me ever since.

This toolbox enabled machine learning algorithms to analyze seismic data from a range of sources, by directly accessing, gathering, and processing data. My work involved the manipulation and processing of seismological data using Obspy, as well as using ObspyDMT to read and write data to multiple file formats from different seismic data centers. During the Fall 2022 semester, I continued working on a similar project where I analyzed large quantities of seismic data to create an algorithm that could detect underground nuclear explosions using seismic data stations across the United States. This allowed me to further develop my skills in data analysis and algorithm development. In addition to my work at Brookhaven, I also interned at NASA during the Summer of 2021. While there, I worked closely with the NASA team to develop a CubeSat capable of measuring the probability of a wildfire starting, and detecting and locating a fire in progress. My work involved coding a Raspberry Pi, designing 3D models, and creating electrical system diagrams. I also produced weekly progress reports and worked collaboratively with the team to ensure project success. Through these experiences, I have gained valuable knowledge and skills in software development, data analysis, and engineering design. I am eager to continue building upon these experiences and applying my knowledge to future projects.",Electrical Engineering Computer Science Aerospace Engineering Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence Robotics and Automation Green Technology / Renewable Energy,1,Mulugeta,Dugda,mulugeta.dugda@morgan.edu,Oluwatobi,Busari,oluwatobi.busari@morgan.edu,

While my undergraduate studies taught me how everything works, I found that the deeper question of 'why' was something I could better explore through personal and supervised research. I see graduate school as an opportunity to research all the things I am interested in and gain a more focused perspective. As a person passionate about innovation, I believe that the ability to research and develop is a valuable skill that I can explore further in graduate school. Specifically, I am drawn to this program as I believe it will equip me with the skills needed to maximize my opportunities and help me tell my unique story.",1,"I am currently working in a research lab to create a material that can selectively detect three heavy chemicals in water and three pesticides. The material needs to match the performance of existing resources, but without the use of precious metals. n this lab I use an electrovoltmeter to read and understand how the compostion of material affects its ability to perform. I also have training in atomic microscope usage.",Robotics Energy,2,Leland,Weiss,lweiss@latech.edu,Ron,Gill,rgill@latech.edu,

I want to reach the peak of my field and graduate school is a necessary stop on the way. Also, I have always wanted to be involved in research and by going to graduate school, I will be able to partake in high-level research. Although I had resolved to go to graduate school, I thought about it as some far-off decision, far away in the future and never really gave it any real thought. After a visit to Virginia Tech and some great discussions about graduate school, I have now realized that it is much closer than I had thought, and I need to start preparing and planning for it. During the visit, I was told about the A Step to Doctorate program and how it would help me in my preparation for graduate school and I chose to apply to be a part of it. Through the program, I will be able to be a part of a community that will provide support and resources as I pursue my higher education and further. This community and the resources will be a great opportunity in order to achieve my goals and therefore, I want to be a part of it.",1,"I have worked for about a semester and half with the Rocketry Program at Morgan State on a liquid fueled rocket's propellant tanks, specifically cryo collapse.

For example, I was the first in my family to acquire Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in any subject, let alone Engineering. I am also the first in my family to work at the management level in the corporate world. While I am grateful for my accomplishment thus far, I am intrigued by the prospect of achieving another first by earning a Ph.D. from the Grado Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering (ISE) at Virginia Tech. More important than being first, I have an overwhelming desire to make meaningful contributions to industry and society. I see enrolling as a Ph.D. student in Industrial & Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech and becoming a research academic as my vehicle toward attaining this goal. Regarding research, I am interested in exploring the intersection of management systems, information technology, and human factors. While working industry as a subordinate and then as a manager, I noticed that optimizing how humans fit into production processes was a research stream with many interesting gaps. For example, I came to appreciate the human element’s central role in production and why it needs to be explicitly and thoughtfully integrated into the management systems framework. However, I found there to be a lack of accessible and implementable quantitative models that explicitly accounted for the human element—especially those addressing workplace safety and comfort in the production setting.",1,,", I am interested in exploring the intersection of management systems, information technology, and human factors",1,Deborah,Dickerson,debdickerson@vt.edu,Taylan G.,Topcu,ttopcu@vt.edu,

From counting Cheerios with my cousin to crunching numbers in my calculator, I knew that math was my passion. I even came to Virginia Tech as a math major, but math became a struggle, so I decided to switch to Economics. Although I was taking economics courses, my love for math never went away. Now, being a Junior in college, I have honestly enjoyed all of my classes, and the fire I have inside is still lit and ready for school. Contrary to many other students, I am passionate about school and try my best to complete assignments ahead of time. I want to continue my studies in Mathematics and help others with the knowledge I gain. I know that graduate school will not be easy, but I won't be alone during the process. I want to participate in this program because it'll better prepare me for the next steps after my Undergraduate college career. Given my limited knowledge and understanding of graduate school, I anticipate this program will provide valuable insights and guidance in making a well-informed decision. I always had a hard time being persistent in something, but school never gave me a struggle. There were some classes, like Calculus or Physics, but I never gave up and tried my best. Graduate school is not a given, but I am determined to inspire others and achieve the goals I have set forth for myself.
